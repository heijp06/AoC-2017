There are 2 kinds of permutations here.
- Name permutations: partner: Permutes on the names of the items: pe/b (where e and b are the names).
- Position permutations: spin and exchange: Permute on the position of the items.

These 2 types of permutations are independent in the sense that we can do all permutations of 1 type
first and then do all permutations of the other type. (Permutations of the same type should always be
done in the order they came in the input.)

Below are the accumulated permutations of all name and position permutations in the input
and their periods.

To do 1 billion permutation is equivalent to doing 1 billion mod period permutations.

The final result is found by first doing the name permutations and then the position permutations.

name permutation

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p 
f c m b g o n k e i h p a d j l 

a -> f
f -> o
o -> j
j -> i
i -> e
e -> g
g -> n
n -> d
d -> b
b -> c
c -> m
m -> a

h -> k
k -> h

l -> p
p -> l

Period = 12

1000000000 % 12 = 4

position permutation

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p 
n b c p k i o g j a l f h e d m 

a -> n
n -> e
e -> k
k -> l
l -> f
f -> i
i -> j
j -> a

b -> b

c -> c

d -> p
p -> m
m -> h
h -> g
g -> o
o -> d

Period = 24

1000000000 % 12 = 16
